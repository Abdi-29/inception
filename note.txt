You can use docker-compose up to create the images if they don't already exist,
and then run the docker-compose.yml file to turn them into connected containers.

docker-compose down stops the containers, and the -v flag removes the volumes.
If you want to reboot the whole thing, docker-compose down -v and then remove
all of the images by using 'docker rmi $(docker image ls)'
